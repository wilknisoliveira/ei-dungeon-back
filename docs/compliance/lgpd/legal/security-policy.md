# Security Policy

**Audit Date:** 2026-07-24
**Repository:** ei-dungeon-back
**Status:** Partially documented — technical controls identified; organizational policy required

---

## 1. Technical Security Controls (Evidence-Based)

The following controls were verified through code audit:

### 1.1 Authentication

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Password hashing | BCrypt (with legacy SHA256 migration) | `EncryptionService.cs` |
| JWT signing | HMAC-SHA256 | `TokenService.cs:29` |
| Token validation | Issuer, Audience, Lifetime, Signing Key | `Program.cs:69-72` |
| Refresh token hashing | SHA256 | `SigninUseCase.cs:75` |
| Refresh token rotation | Old token deleted, new token created | `RefreshTokenUseCase.cs:53,69-76` |
| Refresh token revocation | Single-session and full logout | `LogoutUseCase.cs:30-40` |
| User enumeration protection | Generic errors on duplicate username and failed login | `CreateUserUseCase.cs:23-25`, `SigninUseCase.cs:40` |

### 1.2 Authorization

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Role-based access control | Admin, CommonUser, PremiumUser roles | `[Authorize(Roles)]` on controllers |
| Data isolation | Game ownership validation | `GetGameByIdUseCase.cs` |
| Least privilege defaults | New users assigned CommonUser | `CreateUserUseCase.cs` |

### 1.3 Rate Limiting

| Policy | Limit | Window | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Login | 5 req | 1 min | `POST /api/user/auth/signin` |
| Signup | 3 req | 1 min | `POST /api/user` |
| Refresh | 10 req | 1 min | `POST /api/user/auth/refresh` |
| UsernameCheck | 20 req | 1 min | `GET /api/user/check-userinfo` |
| Authenticated | 120 req | 1 min | All authenticated endpoints |

- **Partition:** Client IP
- **Algorithm:** Sliding window
- **Evidence:** `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:97-160`

### 1.4 Encryption in Transit

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| HTTPS redirect | `UseHttpsRedirection()` | `Program.cs:196` |
| HSTS | NOT IMPLEMENTED | — |
| TLS for LLM calls | OpenAI SDK uses HTTPS | `GenAi.cs:36` |

### 1.5 Database Security

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Parameterized queries | EF Core LINQ throughout | All repository files |
| Raw SQL parameterization | `FromSqlRaw` with positional params | `GameInfoRepository.cs:22` |
| Connection string management | Config-based, not hardcoded | `Program.cs:126` |

### 1.6 Logging

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Structured logging | Serilog (console + file) | `Program.cs:28-34` |
| Log rotation | Daily, 7-day retention, 10 MB max | `Program.cs:29-34` |
| Sensitive data exclusion | Passwords, tokens, emails NOT logged | Verified in controllers |
| PII in logs | Usernames logged in plaintext | `AuthController.cs:80,140` |

### 1.7 Exception Handling

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Global exception handler | `AppExceptionHandler` | `Program.cs:49` |
| Client-safe messages | Generic "Something went wrong" | `AppExceptionHandler.cs:27` |
| Internal details hidden | Stack traces logged, not returned | `AppExceptionHandler.cs:30` |

### 1.8 CORS

| Control | Implementation | Evidence |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Configurable origins | `Cors:AllowedOrigins` config | `Program.cs:103-113` |
| Default | `http://localhost:4200` | `Program.cs:108` |
| Credentials | Allowed | `Program.cs:111` |

## 2. Organizational Security Policy

**NOT_CREATED** — The repository does not contain an organizational security policy document.

The following would need to be defined:

1. **Information security policy** — overall approach to data security
2. **Access control policy** — who has access to what systems
3. **Password policy** — organizational requirements beyond code-level minimums
4. **Incident response policy** — how security incidents are handled
5. **Data classification policy** — how data is categorized and protected
6. **Vendor management policy** — how third-party providers are assessed
7. **Backup and recovery policy** — database backup strategy
8. **Change management policy** — how code changes are reviewed and deployed
9. **Physical security policy** — where servers and data are stored
10. **Employee training policy** — security awareness training

## 3. Observations

### 3.1 Strong Technical Foundation

The application implements solid technical security controls:
- BCrypt password hashing (industry standard)
- JWT with full validation
- Refresh token rotation and revocation
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting
- Parameterized queries
- HTTPS enforcement

### 3.2 Gaps Requiring Organizational Action

1. No organizational security policy document
2. No incident response procedure
3. No access control policy beyond RBAC
4. No vendor assessment for OpenRouter/Railway
5. No backup policy visible in repository
6. No HSTS headers
7. No account lockout mechanism
