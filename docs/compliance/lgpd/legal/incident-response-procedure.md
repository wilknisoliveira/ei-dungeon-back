## 1. Technical Detection Capabilities

The following are already available in the codebase:

| Capability | Implementation | Location |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Application logging | Serilog (console + rolling file) | `Infrastructure/Logs/logs.txt`, 7-day retention |
| Exception logging | `AppExceptionHandler` logs stack traces at Error level | `Infrastructure/Exceptions/AppExceptionHandler.cs:30` |
| Health monitoring | PostgreSQL health check + UI dashboard | `GET /health`, `/healthDashboard` |
| Rate limiting | IP-based sliding window (5 policies) | `Infrastructure/Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:97-160` |
| HTTPS enforcement | `UseHttpsRedirection()` | `Program.cs:196` |
| CORS | Configurable allowed origins | `Program.cs:103-113` |

---

## 2. Incident Classification

### 2.1 Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **SEV-1** | Critical | Active data breach, unauthorized access to personal data, service completely down | Immediate (< 1 hour) | Database compromise, JWT secret leaked, mass data exfiltration |
| **SEV-2** | High | Confirmed security incident with potential data exposure | < 4 hours | Unauthorized admin access, API key compromised, targeted attack detected |
| **SEV-3** | Medium | Suspicious activity, potential vulnerability exploited | < 24 hours | Unusual rate limit triggers, repeated failed logins from new IPs, anomalous error patterns |
| **SEV-4** | Low | Minor security event, no confirmed data exposure | < 72 hours | Single failed login attempt, minor config drift, non-critical service degradation |

### 2.2 Incident Categories

| Category | Description | LGPD Relevance |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Data Breach** | Unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, personal data | Art. 48 — ANPD and data subject notification required |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Account compromise, privilege escalation, bypass of auth controls | Art. 48 — assess if personal data was exposed |
| **Service Disruption** | DDoS, infrastructure failure, database outage | Art. 48 — assess if availability of personal data is affected |
| **Data Integrity** | Unauthorized modification of personal data | Art. 48 — assess scope of modified data |
| **Third-Party Incident** | Security event at OpenRouter, Railway, or PostgreSQL provider | Art. 48 — assess if user data was affected |
| **Internal Misconfiguration** | Secrets exposed, CORS too permissive, logging PII | Assess exposure; may require notification |

## 4. Response Procedure

### Phase 1: Detection and Triage

```
1. Incident detected (alert, user report, log analysis, health check failure)
2. Initial assessment:
   a. What happened?
   b. When did it happen?
   c. What systems are affected?
   d. What data may be involved?
   e. Is the incident ongoing?
3. Classify severity (SEV-1 through SEV-4)
4. Notify Incident Commander
5. Create incident record (use Section 8 template)
6. Begin containment if ongoing
```

### Phase 2: Containment

```
Short-term containment:
  - Isolate affected systems
  - Block malicious IPs (update CORS, rate limiting, or firewall)
  - Revoke compromised credentials (JWT secret, API keys, user sessions)
  - Force logout all sessions: DELETE refresh tokens via database
  - If API key compromised: rotate keys immediately

Long-term containment:
  - Deploy emergency fixes
  - Enable additional logging
  - Set up monitoring on affected areas
  - Preserve evidence (logs, database snapshots)
```

**Application-specific containment actions:**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| JWT secret compromised | Generate new secret, invalidate all existing tokens (delete all refresh tokens), redeploy |
| OpenRouter API key compromised | Rotate key in OpenRouter dashboard, update User Secrets/env vars, redeploy |
| Database credentials exposed | Rotate PostgreSQL password, update connection string, redeploy |
| Admin account compromised | Reset admin password, revoke all refresh tokens, review role assignments |
| User data exposed via API | Identify affected users, assess scope, patch vulnerability |
| Rate limiting bypassed | Identify spoofed IPs, update rate limiting partition key logic |

### Phase 3: Eradication

```
1. Identify root cause
2. Remove threat/malware/unauthorized access
3. Patch vulnerability
4. Verify clean state
5. Update dependencies if vulnerable package identified
```

### Phase 4: Recovery

```
1. Restore services from clean backups if needed
2. Verify system integrity
3. Confirm all services operational
4. Monitor for recurrence
5. Resume normal operations
```

### Phase 5: Post-Incident

```
1. Complete incident record (Section 8)
2. Conduct post-incident review
3. Document lessons learned
4. Implement preventive measures
5. Update this procedure if gaps were identified
6. File regulatory notifications if required (see Section 6)
```

## 5. LGPD Notification Requirements
